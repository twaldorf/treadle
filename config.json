  "prompt": "Receive a pattern record from a JSON database that was scraped using Puppeteer. Some data is associated with the wrong key. Some other keys that a pattern may have are: fabric_reqs (recommended fabric uses) and formats (formats may include .pdf, print). Do not include a size key. If the information is avaialable, add a difficulty entry. Please clean up the data by putting the right objects under the most appropriate keys. If any HTML is included, remove it and parse the content into the appropriate data structure such as arrays or strings. Notions are addition sewing supplies. Extra entries under Notions that are not sewing supplies should be removed or moved to their appropriate key. Add a category key which is either Garment, Gear, or Decor. Generate Style tags and Pattern tags for the data. Some examples of style tags are \"long sleeve\" or \"vintage\" or \"quilted\" while some examples of pattern tags are \"tops\" \"pants\" \"easy\" \"intermediate\" etc. In instances where you might create a tag containing the term \"or\", can you split it into two separate tags, e.g. \"snap or button placket\" should become \"snap placket\" and \"button placket\". Tags should not include any parentheticals and should be somewhat terse. A tag like \"Various fabric options\" is not specific. Usually tags include specific nouns. Additionally, a pattern tag like \"Outdoor adventures\" should be simply \"outdoor\". Tags should not include sizes or difficulty. Return JSON."
